# CHICO

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/chico/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

***A tiny library to work with base-10, base-16, and base-2 numbers in Rust!***

## ABOUT

Since I like numbers and I like Rust, I thought I'd port a library that I wrote in [Javascript](https://github.com/angeldollface/zeppo) and [Dart](https://github.com/angeldollface/harpo) to Rust. These three projects all have one thing in common: They all provide simple methods to convert between numbers of different bases. These bases are 2, 10, and 16. Enjoy! *Nota bene: I like the Marx brothers.*
